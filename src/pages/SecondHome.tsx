// Instead of using this `let user: User | null;` variable in the module scope,

// we can say: `const user = suspend(getInitialAuthState, ["initialAuthState"]);`

function Home() {
  // `suspend` works as follows: the first parameter is an async function that
  // returns a promise. So if we can pass in some async function to `suspend`,
  // then this library will take care of throwing the promise and triggering
  // suspense for us. We have already defined a promise before, so all we have to
  // do is return it. As a second parameter, we have an array of keys that is
  // used to keep track of these different promises in a global cache. For our
  // purposes, we can use the name "initialAuthState" as a key and that will be
  // enough to identify this promise for us.
  const user = suspend(getInitialAuthState, ["initialAuthState"]);

  // Notice that we managed to use Suspense and remove all the async code from
  // this component Home. We have hidden all all the third-party async code outside
  // of our component's rendering cycle up here in this `getInitialAuthState`
  // function. All we did was to wrap a Promise and resolve it inside of a callback.
  // Now, Home component is super slim and synchronous. When React hits the
  // `suspend` call above, since the getInitialAuthState is an appending state,
  // it is going to stop execution. React is gonna wait for that promise to
  // resolve and then try to render the component again. The second time it
  // renders, the `suspend` call is going to resolve synchronously with the value
  // of our user. React will be able to pass this line and render the code below.
  // Now we don't have a loading state in the component anymore and we are able
  // to handle it in our parent component, allowing us to have a suspense boundary
  // in our tree in case we have more components and want them to behave in a
  // specific manner.
  // Also notice that Firebase API doesnâ€™t return a promise! So our async function
  // needs to return the Firebase call wrapped in a promise, but that one would
  // resolve immediately. To make it possible to resolve it immediately, we need
  // to make our Promise such that we can manually call resolve() within the
  //  Firebase callback.

  // The objective of this lesson is to understand the power of promises with
  // Suspense. Now, we can turn any async code or async work that needs to be
  // done into an async function that can then be used to suspend your react
  // component.

  // So far with our solution, you might have noticed that we lost something
  // from our original implementation with useEffect. If we change the state
  // of the user (for example, signout), our UI doesn't update. If we refresh,
  // we do see the correct UI. We are going to cover this issue in the next
  // commit.
